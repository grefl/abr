analyse, build, replace

This repo houses replacements of Apps/services that I use on my phone or computer. Rather than use someone else's tool, I create my own version of it so I can add features that I want rather than relying on some company to do things that suit me.

This is not meant to be a replacement for everything and is not a crazy build-my-own-walled-garden effort. It is a learning experience and is meant to improve my life and give me more control over the things I use. I find the best way to learn is to do real projects that make my life better. What better way to be motivated than to do a project making tools that you use everyday? (seriously, if you know a better way, email me) 

> analyse, build, replace is the philosophy of making your own version of an App/service that you use regularly by first 'analysing' it, 'building' it yourself, 'replacing' it with your own version.

 > abr is a joke riff on Microsoft's EEE. abr is conceptually more moral but less profitable.
